> The Configuration Management library for your Node.js application

## Introduction

The goal with Centig is to give the developers the opportunity to have all configuration in one single file with a clear hierarchical structure. Centig provides a distinct configuration schema with a simple overview of the context and the origin of each value. Therefore, Centig does not involve in overriding and extending configurations. Each value can be configured very differently, depending on how important or dynamic the value can be. Centig has a validation-first approach (by default) where it should **NOT** be possible to start the application without having all the values ​​present that were defined in the schema.
